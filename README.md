# LanguageRecognizer
This is a project I developed during one challenge at the Apple Developer Academy. The goal of this challenge was to learn about the Machine Learning, how it works, how it can be used and how it can be developed.
With that being said, Iâ€™ve developed this project that, by using the Natural Language Model, can detect in what language your input is(writing input).
In here you can find the link to a medium article I wrote about this subject (https://medium.com/@giuseppesica/machine-learning-what-about-77b218bc2e58)
Hope this is useful!
